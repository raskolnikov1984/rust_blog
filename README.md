# Learning Repository

Welcome to my learning repository! This repository serves as a platform for me to explore and implement various technologies using Rust as the primary programming language. Below, I'll provide an overview of the key components and technologies used in this project.

## Overview

This project is an implementation utilizing Rust, Diesel (ORM), Actix (API), and PostgreSQL. It's primarily aimed at learning and experimenting with these technologies in a real-world scenario.

## Technologies Used

### Rust

Rust is a powerful systems programming language known for its speed, reliability, and memory safety. It provides modern features that enable efficient and safe concurrent programming.

### Diesel (ORM)

Diesel is a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and query builder for Rust. It allows developers to interact with databases in a type-safe and efficient manner, providing compile-time guarantees and robust abstractions.

### Actix (API)

Actix is a high-performance, actor-based framework for building concurrent and scalable applications in Rust. It provides a flexible and ergonomic foundation for developing web APIs with minimal overhead.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a popular open-source relational database management system known for its reliability, extensibility, and SQL compliance. It provides robust features for storing and querying structured data.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to deepen my understanding of Rust programming language, explore database interactions using Diesel ORM, build efficient and scalable web APIs with Actix, and gain practical experience with PostgreSQL.
